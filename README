My configuration files
======================

Mac OS X Mavericks
Use brew as package management

```
mkdir -p ~/src
git clone git@github.com:git/git.git ~/git
git clone git@github.com:lvv/git-prompt.git ~/git-prompt
brew install autojump
```

Use rbenv as ruby version management

```
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

BASH
======
`cat "[[ -f path/to/bashrc.common ]] && . path/to/bashrc.common" > ~/.bash_profile`


VIM
====================================
This is the current setting I use. If you plan to use this for your
configuration, please note that you will need Ruby installed and in your path
(for the fuzzy finder textmate plugin). Here are the plugins I use:
  - NERD_tree (file browser)
  - NERD Commenter (commenting)
  - Snipmate (snippet completion)
  - Scratch (temoprary buffer)
  - Rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - Vim-LaTeX suite (for TeX/LaTeX)
  - Fuzzy_Finder_Textmate (search for files and open)
  - Gist (make gits to gist.github.com)
  - VCS-Git (Git Distributed VCS support)
  - Matchit
  - Ack
  - Grep
  - Imaps
  - MiniBufferExplorer
  - and some more

A few colorchemes are included, where some of them are directly from the
default vim installation in Fedora. To get the best view of the color schemes
t_Co=256 is set in the .vimrc file.

To use grep plugin, do this.
```
sudo port install findutils
sudo mv /usr/bin/xargs /usr/bin/xargs.origin
sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/gxargs /usr/bin/xargs
```

For ruby development helper tools,
```
gem install rcodetools
```

How to use this as your configuration
---------------------------------------
It's straight forward if you don't have custom Vim configuration. Just
clone this repo and either link (ln -s) or copy the
  1. vimrc as ~/.vimrc
  2. vim/ as ~/.vim
  3. gvimrc as ~/.gvimrc

That's all.

Thanks goes to many many Vim users for making the plugins, snippets, syntax,
etc. files and also for making their Vim configuration public so that I could
learn from them.
