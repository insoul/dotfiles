Gavim - Gaveen's Vim Configuration
====================================

This is the Vim configuration I actually use.

I'm working on a Fedora Linux system. By default there's a very decent Vim
configuration in Fedora. So I took the default global Vim configuration file
in a Fedora 10 system and did the tweaks to get it to my liking. As you would
have expected, a significant part of the vimrc is straight from Fedora. While
some of the plugins are taken from vim.org, some are taken from the source.

This is the current setting I use. If you plan to use this for your
configuration, please note that you will need Ruby installed and in your path
(for the fuzzy finder textmate plugin). Here are the plugins I use:
  - NERD_tree (file browser)
  - NERD Commenter (commenting)
  - Snipmate (snippet completion)
  - Scratch (temoprary buffer)
  - Rails (for Ruby on Rails)
  - Vim-LaTeX suite (for TeX/LaTeX)
  - Fuzzy_Finder_Textmate (search for files and open)
  - Gist (make gits to gist.github.com)
  - VCS-Git (Git Distributed VCS support)
  - Matchit
  - and some more

Vim 7.2 already has some great additional features like spell checking, word
completion, etc. I'm only interested in maintaining this configuration for the
Vim version I'm using, which happened to be 7.2 as of this writing.

A few colorchemes are included, where some of them are directly from the
default vim installation in Fedora. To get the best view of the color schemes
t_Co=256 is set in the .vimrc file.


How to use this as your configuration
---------------------------------------
It's straight forward if you don't have custom Vim configuration. Just
clone this repo and either link (ln -s) or copy the
  1. vimrc as ~/.vimrc
  2. vim/ as ~/.vim
  3. gvimrc as ~/.gvimrc

That's all.

Thanks goes to many many Vim users for making the plugins, snippets, syntax,
etc. files and also for making their Vim configuration public so that I could
learn from them.
